This is the readme file of the ILK-Compiler tool.

# Usage

## Prerequisites

A `Lua` interpreter and [`luarocks`](https://luarocks.org/) are required.
Please install them from your package manager (or from sources).

**NOTE**: getting luarocks using `apt-get install` may result in inconsistencies
between Lua and Luarocks, on Ubuntu.

For example:

```
sudo apt-get install lua5.2 liblua5.2-dev
wget http://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/releases/luarocks-2.4.4.tar.gz
tar zxvf luarocks-2.4.4.tar.gz
cd luarocks-2.4.4/
./configure --lua-version=5.2
make build
sudo make install
cd ..
```

Then, install Lua dependencies using luarocks:

```
cd etc/
luarocks install --local --only-deps ilkcompiler-<version>.rockspec
```


## Running the tool

First issue this command in your shell:

```
eval `luarocks path`
```

Then you can run the actual compiler; no arguments or the `--help` switch
will show some usage information:

```
./ilk-compiler.lua --help
```


# Generated code

The output directory will contain the code generated by the compiler, in the
language selected with the `--backend` switch. Currently, three backends (i.e.
target languages) are supported:

- C++/Eigen (`--backend=eigen`)
- Python/Numpy (`--backend=numpy`)
- Julia (`--backend=julia`)


## C++ / Eigen backend

### Building

You will need the Eigen3 C++ library installed in your system, including
the corresponding `pkg-config` configuration file (which is usually
`/usr/local/share/pkgconfig/eigen3.pc`). This file will be installed if you
follow the standard `make` procedure for Eigen.

You also need our Eigen backend library, which is shipped within this
repository. It is a minimal collection of support functions referenced by the
generated code.
Please build and install it in your system, using the standard CMake procedure:

```
cd backend/eigen
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

Afterwards, you can build the generated code also with `cmake`; in the output
directory where the code was generated:

```
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make
```

Type `make edit_cache` to change some options, like enabling the building of the
tests.

## Python/Numpy backend

Please add to your `PYTHONPATH` the location of our Python backend package,
which is `backend/ilknumpy` -- the full path of `backend/` must appear in
`PYTHONPATH`, as `ilknumpy` is the actual package.

## Julia backend

Please set the `JULIA_LOAD_PATH` environment variable with the path of our Julia
backend module (under `backend/julia`) and the path with the generated code. For
example:

```
export JULIA_LOAD_PATH=.../ilk-compiler/backend/julia/:/tmp/ilkgen/julia:
```

Do not forget the trailing `:`.
