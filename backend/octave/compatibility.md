# Supported by Octave but NOT supported by Matlab

- starting an identifier with underscore, e.g. `_a_variable`
- using `#` for line comments
- the auto-increment operator and the like, e.g. `+=`
- clearer keywords such as `endif` `endwhile` - only `end` in Matlab
- indexing expressions, as in `(v1 + v2)(index)`
- chain assignments, like `a = b = 4`
- multiple return values without square brackets, like `a,b,c = f(x);`
