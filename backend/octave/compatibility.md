# Supported by Octave but NOT supported by Matlab

- starting an identifier with underscore, e.g. `_a_variable`
- using `#` for line comments
- the auto-increment operator and the like, e.g. `+=`
- clearer keywords such as `endif` `endwhile` - only `end` in Matlab
- indexing expressions, as in `(v1 + v2)(index)`
